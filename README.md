# atom-transpiler-debug-tool

This package is a small debugging utility intended for use with [Atom](https://atom.io/) packages which rely on Atom's "custom transpiler" feature. When installed, it can analyze your package's configuration to determine which files are associated with each custom transpiler it relies on, as well as the current state of the compile cache for each source file. This analysis can help shed light on unexpected behavior and determine whether your package is configured properly.

## Usage

From your package's root directory:
```sh
npm install atom-transpiler-debug-tool --save-dev
```

Then in your package.json file, add a script:
```js
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "debug": "atom-transpiler-debug-tool"
  }
}
```

Now you can `npm run debug` from your package's root directory and the debug information will be printed to stdout!
